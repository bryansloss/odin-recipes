    <h2>Simple risotto for the whole family</h2>
    <p>Don't be intimidated by what you hear about cooking risotto. It is not as difficult as you think! Making risotto
        is just like cooking rice, but you are adding more flavor and stirring in an open pot instead of steaming.</p>
    <p>Add whatever mix-ins you'd like: mushrooms, chicken, brussels sprouts, you name it. Risotto is an opportunity to
        experiment and create something unique to your tastes!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1 C</strong> Arborio Rice</li>
        <li><strong>4 C</strong> Chicken Stock (or vegetable stock)</li>
        <li><strong>2</strong> shallots, minced</li>
        <li><strong>1 C</strong> white wine</li>
        <li><strong>4 TBSP</strong> Butter</li>
        <li>Parmagiano Reggiano cheese, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt 2 TBSP butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add stock to another saucepan over low heat. WHen
            butter is melted, add shallots and sautee until just softened.</li>
        <li>Add rice to shallots and stir to coat with butter. Cook rice until slightly browned, 3-5 minutes. Add wine
            to deglaze the pan. The wine will bubble up quickly and absorb into the rice.</li>
        <li>When rice has absorbed the wine add a ladlefull of stock, enough to cover the rice, and reduce heat to a low
            simmer. Once rice has absorbed stock, continue adding more stock one ladle at a time, stirring gently every
            so often.</li>
        <li>When all of the stock is gone, the rice should be fully cooked. Add salt and taste to adjust for seasoning.
            Stir in 2 more TBSP butter.</li>
        <li>Serve in large bowls and top with tons of cheese!</li>
    </ol>
